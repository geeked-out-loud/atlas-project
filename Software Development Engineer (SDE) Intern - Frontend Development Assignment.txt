Software Development Engineer (SDE) Intern - Frontend Development Assignment
Assignment Overview
In this task, you will develop a "Personalized Content Dashboard" for users to track and interact with data in an engaging, dynamic interface. The dashboard will present content such as news, recommendations, and social posts from multiple sources, and it will allow users to interact with and customize their dashboard experience. You will be challenged to use React, Next.js, TypeScript, Redux Toolkit, API Integration, and Testing to create an interactive, user-centric platform.
This project will assess your understanding of frontend architecture, state management, API handling, complex UI designs, and testing best practices.
Duration: 48 hours from assignment receipt.
Submission: Provide a GitHub repository link with a clear README file, including instructions on how to run the project. Optionally, include a live demo link.

Project Requirements
1. Core Features:
Personalized Content Feed:
* User Preferences: The user can configure their content preferences (e.g., favorite categories such as technology, sports, finance) from a settings panel. Use local storage or Redux to persist these settings.

* Data Fetching: Fetch personalized content from two APIs:

   * News API (e.g., NewsAPI): Fetch the latest news based on user preferences (categories).

   * Recommendations API (e.g., TMDB API or Spotify API): Show personalized movie or music recommendations based on user history or preferences.

   * Social Media API (e.g., Twitter, Instagram): Display posts based on specific hashtags or user profiles (this can be a mock API if necessary).

      * Interactive Content Cards:

         * Display cards for each content piece (e.g., news article, recommendation) with images, headlines, brief descriptions, and call-to-action buttons like "Read More" or "Play Now".

         * Implement infinite scrolling or pagination for efficient display of content.

2. User Dashboard Layout:
            * Main Layout: Create a responsive dashboard layout with a sidebar for navigation and a top header with a search bar, user settings, and account info.

            * Sections:

               * Personalized Feed Section: Display the news, recommendations, and social posts in one unified feed.

               * Trending Section: Display top trending items based on categories (e.g., trending news, movies, posts).

               * Favorite Section: Users can mark content as favorite, and the dashboard will display it under a personalized “Favorites” section.

3. Search Functionality:
                  * Search Bar: Allow users to search for content across different categories (e.g., search for a movie, news, or social media post).

                  * Debounced Search: Implement a debounced search functionality to optimize performance while the user types.

4. Advanced UI/UX Features:
                     * Drag-and-Drop for Content Organization: Allow users to drag and reorder the content cards in their feed. Use React DnD or Framer Motion for smooth, interactive drag-and-drop functionality.

                     * Dark Mode: Implement dark mode toggle using CSS custom properties and Tailwind CSS.

                     * Animations: Include smooth transitions between sections, loading spinners, and card hover effects using Framer Motion or CSS animations.

5. State Management & Logic Handling:
                        * Redux Toolkit: Use Redux Toolkit for managing the global state (e.g., user preferences, content data).

                        * Async Logic: Use Redux Thunks or RTK Query to handle asynchronous data fetching from the APIs.

                        * Local Storage: Save the user’s preferences (e.g., favorite categories, dark mode preference) in localStorage or Redux Persist to maintain session data across page reloads.

6. Testing:
                           * Unit Testing: Write unit tests for the main components, focusing on edge cases and logic flows (e.g., user preferences, API responses).

                           * Integration Testing: Ensure that content is rendered properly when it is fetched and handle edge cases like no content, empty states, and errors.

                           * E2E Testing: Use Cypress or Playwright to test critical user flows, such as:

                              * Search functionality.

                              * Drag-and-drop reordering.

                              * User authentication (if applicable).

7. Bonus Features (Optional):
                                 * Authentication: Implement user login/signup using NextAuth.js or mock authentication. Allow users to customize their profile.

                                 * Real-time Data: Implement a real-time feed where content (e.g., social media posts or news) gets updated periodically via WebSockets or Server-Sent Events.

                                 * Multi-language Support: Implement language switching using react-i18next for internationalization.
